# Emotions Classification using Machine Learning

This Natural Language Processing (NLP) project aims to classify emotions from text using classical Machine Learning techniques. It showcases a full pipeline from preprocessing and exploration to training and evaluating multiple ML models on a labeled dataset.

## üìå Project Highlights

- **Dataset**: Text samples labeled with distinct emotions (e.g., joy, sadness, anger).
- **Preprocessing**:
  - Lowercasing, punctuation removal, and stopword filtering
  - Tokenization and lemmatization using NLTK
  - Feature extraction via TF-IDF
- **Machine Learning Models**:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  - Random Forest Classifier
- **Evaluation Metrics**:
  - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score
  - Confusion Matrix
- **Visualization**:
  - Emotion distribution plots
  - WordClouds for each emotion
  - Performance comparison among models

## üöÄ Objectives

- Build accurate emotion classifiers using classical ML techniques
- Compare the performance of multiple ML models
- Explore how text preprocessing impacts model outcomes

## üìÅ Repository Contents

- `Final NLP Project (Emotions Classification using ML and DL).ipynb`: Main Jupyter notebook with full code and analysis
